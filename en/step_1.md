## What you will make

You will teach a computer to tell you if you are holding an apple or a tomato.

Then you will improve the classifier, using more diverse training data.

You will need a **webcam**, a **red apple**, a **green apple** and a **red tomato**.

You will need to be able to download and save files to your computer.
