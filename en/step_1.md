## What you will make

Train a machine learning model to detect if you are holding an apple or a tomato. Then, improve the classifier by using more diverse training data.

You will need a **webcam**, a **red apple**, a **green apple**, and a **red tomato**.

You will need to be able to download and save files to your computer.
