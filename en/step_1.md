## What you will make

You will teach a computer to tell you if you are holding an apple or a tomato.

Then you will improve the classifier, using more diverse training data.

**TODO**: Trailer:
Video of green apple detected as an apple, a red tomato being detected as a tomato, but confusion with a red apple. More data added. New comparisons show better outcomes.
<html>
  <div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding-top: 177.78%;">
    <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; width: 50%; height: 50%; border: none;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tL629z5lMhU?rel=0&cc_load_policy=1" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share">
    </iframe>
  </div>
</html>

You will need a **webcam**, a **red apple**, a **green apple** and a **red tomato**.

You will need to be able to download and save files to your computer.
