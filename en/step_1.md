## What you will make

Train a machine learning model to detect if you are holding an apple or a tomato. Then, improve the classifier by using more diverse training data.

You will need a **webcam**, a **red apple**, a **green apple**, and a **red tomato**.

You will need to be able to download and save files to your computer.

title: Where are my images stored?
---

- This project uses a technology called 'machine learning'. Machine learning systems are trained using a large amount of data﻿. 
- Our projects do not require you to create an account or log in. For our projects, the image examples you use to make the model are only stored temporarily in your browser (only on your machine).
- No images from your webcam are sent to this website or any other website.
