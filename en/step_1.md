## What you will make

![The image shows a machine learning interface from "Teachable Machine" where a model is being trained to classify images of apples and tomatoes. On the left, there are two labeled sections: "Apple" with 64 image samples and "Tomato" with 24 image samples. Each section shows image thumbnails corresponding to each class (apples and tomatoes) and has options to upload images via webcam or upload button. On the right, there's a "Preview" section showing the result of the model's classification of a webcam input, where a hand is holding a tomato. Below this, the "Output" section displays the classification results: 16% for "Apple" and 84% for "Tomato," indicating the model has identified the object as a tomato.](images/wywm.png)

Train a machine learning model to detect if you are holding an apple or a tomato. Then, improve the classifier by using more diverse training data.

You will need a **webcam**, a **red apple**, a **green apple**, and a **red tomato**.

You will need to be able to download and save files to your computer.

title: Where are my images stored?
---

- This project uses a technology called 'machine learning'. Machine learning systems are trained using a large amount of dataï»¿. 
- Our projects do not require you to create an account or log in. For our projects, the image examples you use to make the model are only stored temporarily in your browser (only on your machine).
- No images from your webcam are sent to this website or any other website.
