The training data is biased, as it is only trained on green apples.

To reduce the bias, you need to add extra examples of apples to the 'Apple' class.

In the 'Apple' class, add some samples of images from one of the folders you have just downloaded.

**Tip**: You only need to add a few extra samples.
